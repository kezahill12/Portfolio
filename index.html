                <p>I’m Hillary, a proud Rwandan with a heart drawn to the beauty of nature. 
                    The endless green hills and peaceful landscapes of my country inspire me and remind me to slow down and appreciate life’s simple treasures. Beyond my love for the outdoors, I find joy in reading—each book opening a door to new ideas, stories,
                     and worlds that spark both my imagination and personal growth.</p>
